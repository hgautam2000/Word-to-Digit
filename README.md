Word-to-Digit
=============

This is Java program that takes the spelling of an number, and converts it into the corresponding integer.The program can still be made significantly better, because it can only identify numbers form 0-10. There is a simple solution, but it is a tedious one. If anyone of you can come up with a solution, feel free me to message me as I am open to anything!
